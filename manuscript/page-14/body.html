But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.'</p><p>'But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'</p></div> </div>
