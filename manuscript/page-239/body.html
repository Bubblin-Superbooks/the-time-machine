I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a momentâ€”a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.</p></div> </div>
